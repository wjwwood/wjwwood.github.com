My name is William and I am a software engineer with a passion for open source robotics.  I have worked on robotics projects through out college and at robotics companies like [Willow Garage](http://www.willowgarage.com/).  I am currently working for [OSRF](http://osrfoundation.org), where I am an active member of the [ROS community](http://ros.org/wiki/) and a core developer for the core [ROS stacks](https://github.com/ros/).  I have been helping design and build the [development tools](https://github.com/ros/catkin/) and [infrastructure tools](https://github.com/ros-infrastrucutre/) used by the ROS community.

Please checkout my [projects](projects.html) or enjoy my ramblings:

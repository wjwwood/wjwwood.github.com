    Comment: hi William,
    I am also a ROS enthusiast. I understand that you used a nice method to install Stage 4 - that was probably much before fuerte (Stage 4.1.1) release. 
    
    I have been developing the Stage tutorials (http://www.ros.org/wiki/stage/Tutorials) and everything worked wonderfully well until Stage 4.1.1 in fuerte - the stage controller tutorials is not working - though these have been designed for Stage 3.2.2 (electric/diamondback) - there should be suitable packages for migration to Stage 4.1.1. 
    
    My question to you, does the stage controllers (with syntax modification for Stage 4 viz. laser  ranger) workd with your installation of Stage 4 ?
    
    Regards,

title: Inadvertent Map of Broun Hall
---
I was showing off my Segway RMP 200 robot with a Kinect on it to some kids here on an engineering camp and I let them drive it around after the presentation and I forgot I had SLAM running with the Sick LiDAR and they inadvertently made a pretty decent map of the basement of Broun Hall =D.
